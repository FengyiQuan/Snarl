example1 is for testing successfully land on a tile<br>
example2 is for testing being captured by an adversary<br>
example3 is for testing sucessfully exited while the door is unlocked<br>
example4 is for testing player picking the key, and also moved to the position of the key<br>
example5 for player enters non-traversable tile<br>
example6 for player not in the state<br>
example7 for player enters tile which already has a player in it<br>
For testing purposes, level could be generated without a key, but I have not set the key to disappear when picked up<br>
